In the original 8080, interrupts worked by having a pin which requested an interrupt along with an internal latch in the cpu to indicate whether interrupts were enabled. Every time an instruction is completed,. How does the cpu handle multiple interrupts? Cpu response to interrupts¶ a key point towards understanding how operating systems work is to understand what the cpu does when an interrupt occurs.

<p>After the cpu acks the interrupt, an interrupt controller (pic) will send the interrupt number back to the cpu. If so, will it deteriorate the handling time and mechanism of the interrupt? It depends on the processor. In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or isr, is a special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition.</p>

<p>The steps in which isr handle interrupts are as follows −. At boot time, when the firmware hands over the control of the system to the kernel, initially just one cpu core is running. At the very basic the interrupt handling system is composed of the hardware and software components. It depends on the processor. Chapter 5 Notes.</p>
