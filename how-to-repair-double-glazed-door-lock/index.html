But it’s getting the right handle for your door or window repair and making the right measurements that are important. Should your upvc door not lock when closed shut, this is due to alignment and in most cases is easy to fix either by adjusting the lock strike/keep. If your upvc door won’t open or isn’t closing as it should, there could be a problem with the lock’s spring mechanism. There are a wide range of reasons why upvc door handles stop working properly, and it can be frustrating and expensive to think that the whole door needs replacing as a result.
