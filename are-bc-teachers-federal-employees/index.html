Camp Staff Easter Seals BC and Yukon From eastersealsbcy.ca
Representing 49,000 teachers, we advocate for a free, inclusive and quality public education system where the learning needs of all students can be met. The federal health and safety legislation is commonly referred to as canada labour code part ii and regulations. She added that teachers aren’t expected to be working over the spring break and that there will be time for collaborative planning when staff return. Education is a provincial jurisdiction in canada so the federal government is not directly.
